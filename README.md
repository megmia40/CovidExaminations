# COVID Examinations

Due to the ongoing pandemic lasting for almost a year now, some states and territories are relaxing their regulations on COVID, and rates of positive tests have been increasing. 
With the spikes in the number of cases, we wanted to figure out which states need to strengthen and enforce their COVID regulations based on how high rates of positive tests are.

Using data from the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, we applied Python to analyze the spreadsheet provided by the organization and categorized U. S. states and territories based on the percentage of positive COVID testing rates.
At the end of our code, we found out which states already have good regulations in place, which states need better ones, and which states desperately have to enforce their regulations.
